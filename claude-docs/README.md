AI Law Firm Chatbot System Architecture

Core Components:

- Private LLM: Self-hosted model (Llama 2/3, Mistral) on private infrastructure
- Voice Processing: Whisper (speech-to-text) + ElevenLabs/Tortoise TTS
- Knowledge Base: Vector database (Chroma/Pinecone) with RAG pipeline
- Decision Engine: Rule-based logic with conversational AI overlay
- CRM Integration: Zoho API connectors

Technical Stack

Backend:

- Python with FastAPI for API services
- LangChain/LlamaIndex for RAG implementation
- PostgreSQL for conversation logs and client data
- Redis for session management
- Docker containers for deployment

AI Components:

- LLM: Llama 2 13B or Mistral 7B (self-hosted)
- Embeddings: Sentence-transformers for document similarity
- Voice: Whisper for STT, custom TTS model for realistic voice
- Fine-tuning: LoRA adapters for legal domain specialization

System Architecture

Inbound Bot Workflow

1. Call Reception: SIP/VoIP integration receives call
2. Voice Processing: Real-time speech-to-text conversion
3. Intent Classification: Determines caller's need using decision tree
4. Knowledge Retrieval: RAG searches internal legal documents
5. Response Generation: LLM generates contextual response
6. Voice Synthesis: Converts text to natural speech
7. CRM Integration: Creates/updates Zoho records automatically

Outbound Bot Workflow

1. Campaign Trigger: Zoho status changes trigger outbound calls
2. Lead Qualification: Retrieves lead data and call history
3. Script Selection: Chooses appropriate conversation flow
4. Call Execution: Automated dialing with voice interaction
5. Dynamic Questioning: Adjusts questions based on responses
6. Data Collection: Updates Zoho with call outcomes and next steps

Key Features

Privacy & Security:

- Air-gapped deployment (no internet access)
- On-premises hosting
- Encrypted data storage
- Audit trails for all interactions

Voice Quality:

- Custom voice cloning for natural conversation
- Real-time processing with <200ms latency
- Emotion detection and appropriate tone adjustment
- Background noise filtering

Decision Trees:

- Visual flow builder for conversation paths
- Conditional branching based on responses
- Escalation rules for complex queries
- Fallback mechanisms for edge cases

Implementation Steps

Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2):

- Set up private infrastructure
- Deploy base LLM model
- Implement RAG pipeline with legal documents

Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4):

- Integrate voice processing (STT/TTS)
- Build decision tree engine
- Create conversation management system

Phase 3 (Weeks 5-6):

- Zoho CRM integration
- Inbound call handling system
- Testing and optimization

Phase 4 (Weeks 7-8):

- Outbound calling capabilities
- Campaign management
- Final testing and deployment

Infrastructure Requirements:

- GPU server for LLM hosting (A100/H100)
- SIP gateway for telephony
- Secure network with no internet access
- Backup and disaster recovery systems

Expected Performance:

- Handle 50+ concurrent calls
- <2 second response time
- 95%+ accuracy in intent detection
- Natural conversation quality

This creates a completely private, domain-specific AI assistant that never sends data outside your
organization.
