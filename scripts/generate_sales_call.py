    ("Sarah", "female", "I hear you. That's actually why I'm calling. We help agencies cut their reporting time in half so teams can focus on client work instead of spreadsheets. Are you currently handling client reports manually or do you have a system?"),

    ("Michael", "male", "That sounds good, but what's the cost? We're watching our budget pretty closely right now."),
    ("Sarah", "female", "I understand. Our pricing starts at $299 per month for up to 25 clients. Given that you hired someone for reporting, you're probably paying what, $3,000-$4,000 a month for that role?"),
    ("Michael", "male", "More like $4,500."),
    ("Sarah", "female", "Right, so even if this just reduces their workload by half, you're looking at real ROI. Plus they could focus on higher-value work."),
    ("Michael", "male", "Maybe. I'd need to see how it actually works though."),
    ("Sarah", "female", "Absolutely. How about this - I can set up a 20-minute demo where I'll connect to your actual data and show you exactly what the reports would look like. No commitment, just see if it fits. Does this Thursday at 2pm work, or is Friday morning better?"),
    ("Michael", "male", "Thursday's tough. What time Friday?"),
    ("Sarah", "female", "How's 10am?"),
    ("Michael", "male", "Yeah, I can do 10am Friday."),
    ("Sarah", "female", "Perfect. I'll send you a calendar invite right now with the Zoom link. I'll also send a quick prep email - if you can have your Google Analytics login ready, I can show you a real report during the call."),
